Caesar's use of the cipher is first described by
Suetonius in his biography of Caesar. Suetonius writes
that Caesar used the cipher to send messages to his
generals during the Gallic Wars. He also writes that
Caesar used the cipher to send messages to the Roman
Senate while he was fighting in the Civil War.

The Caesar cipher is a relatively simple cipher, and
it can be easily broken by modern cryptanalysis
techniques. However, it was an effective cipher in
Caesar's time, and it helped him to keep his military
communications secret.
